### Validated Timer

I was watching a silly sci-fi movie called Moonfall with rocket launches, and I thought, "I wonder how to make a countdown timer", at the same time I was looking at intermittent fasting apps with timers.


I wanted to try scanf for inputs and wanted to try some input validation capabilities.
