# C for Fun
Some playful newbie C code. Just making stuff up as I go and explore while learning.

### [Validated Timer](https://github.com/kierenwuest/CforFun/blob/main/validatedTimer.c)

I was watching a silly sci-fi movie called Moonfall with rocket launches, and I thought, "I wonder how to make a countdown timer", at the same time I was looking at intermittent fasting apps with timers.


I wanted to try scanf for inputs and wanted to try some input validation capabilities.

### [Recursive Swap Character Sort](https://github.com/kierenwuest/CforFun/blob/main/recurNumStrSort.c)

This was a program I got stumpped on in my 42 exam when I couldn't get my head around the recursion. Since solving it I revisitied it to play with ANSI escape codes and usleep() delays to animate the swap sort process.
